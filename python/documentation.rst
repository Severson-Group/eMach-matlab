*eMach* Contribution Guidelines
==========================================

This guide is intended to provide guidelines for contributors to *eMach*. All contributors are expected to follow these 
guidelines with exceptions allowed only in cases as specified within the references. 

Code Style
-------------------------------------------

Using a consistent writing style makes shared code more maintainable, useful, and understandable. Contributors to *eMach*
should follow the `Google Python Style Guidelines for naming <https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#s3.16-naming>`_ 
and code documentation. More information on code documentation will be provided in a later section.

A brief summary of guidelines for names in Python includes:

* Avoid using excessively short names: instead, favor full words to convey meaning
* File, function, and variable names: lowercase with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability
* Class names: start upper case and then move to camel case
* Keep in mind that certain characters add special functionality: for instance, prepending class methods and variable names 
	with double underscore (__) make them private to that class

Naming guidelines derived from PEP 8, used in the Google format as well, are provided below:

Docstrings in Python
--------------------------------------------

A Python docstring is a string literal that occurs as the first statement in a module, function, class, or method definition.
Such a docstring becomes the __doc__ special attribute of that object which can be easily accessed outside the module, 
greatly improving code readability, especially in projects like *eMach* with multiple module interdependencies.

For the purposes of *eMach*, contriubutors are expected to follow the `Google Comments and Docstrings guidelines for code
documentation <https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings>`_. A general guideline which 
helps in greatly improving the usefulness of code documentation is to ensure that docstrings are provided for functions / 
methods and give enough information for users to write a call to any function without having to read the functionâ€™s code.

In addition to the benefits mentioned above, the Google docstrings format is also compatible with the Python Documentation 
Generator tool `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_. As a result, maintaining the above suggested format also 
results directly in the automatic creation of pretty, well indexed documentation of the code base. These documents can be 
hosted online on the Read the Docs platform which supports real-time document updation, or on Github pages via HTML files.
